Server


--------------------------
loads dictionary
waits for connections
file descripter represent a pipe/file


create a socket -- fd for network connection


Design:
main thread produce sockets
put on queue
worker threads pull those socket off the queue

example code in textbook for Producer/Consumer problems
handle critcal sections


critical section = queue
need mutex locks

signal & condition variable 
empty queue --- tell hungry worker threads to "rest" when queue empty --> not wasting CPU resource


worker threads write to -->> log_queue --> logger_thread read this - write to log file
-----------------------------
unordered Set -- C++

check a word in a dictionary --> binary search --> see if my word is aphabetically lower or larger
