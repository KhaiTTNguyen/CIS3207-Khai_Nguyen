create dirs
remove dir

create files
remove filesopen filesclose files

navigate through dir hierarchy
ls & cd


take the cd parsing --> implement getline - check fpr builtins

-----------------
in virtual machine
virtual disk = giant file
ubuntu.vdi - virtual disk image
-----------------


 create a data structure to mamage 

 main memory/RAM is splited into fixed size pages --> need to pick a block & write to 

2 things to create

1. directory entry - structure
every directory has at least 2 dir --> ( . & .. )
    first structure = the directory entry of itself
    second structure = dir entry of parent 

struct dir entry (w/ metadata) {
     name of dir   \ (ROOT)
     size --- number of elements
     starting block - go to block 3 - open up 
     
 }



|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |


2. linkedlist to navigate a file
    3->6->5->NULL
--> so, create a linkedlist
need to make the linkedlist persistent 

find free block 


xxd - hex dump - encode binary to ASCII


reading a block:
- when I runout this block 
- how to know where is next block to go






Note:
in your library, you are not allowed to create any "real" files on the Linux file system itself.
Instead, you have to use the provided helper functions and store all the data that you need on the virtual disk.

 the virtual disk has 16,384 blocks, and each block holds 4KB


 files are stored in a directory and on the virtual disk. 
 In addition, your file system does not have to store more than 256 files (of course, you can create and delete files, 
 and deleted files do not count against this 256 file limit


 out of the 16384 blocks available on disk, 
 only 8,192 must be reserved as data blocks. 
 That is, you have ample of space to store your meta-information. 
 
 --> The maximum file size is 32 megabytes = 32,000 KB (all 8,192 data blocks, each with 4KB).
